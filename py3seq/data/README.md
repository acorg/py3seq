The p-value table file `PVT.3SEQ.2017.700` was downloaded from
[http://mol.ax/3seq](http://mol.ax/3seq) on 2018-11-18.  See Step 3a in
Section 3 of
[the 3seq manual](http://mol.ax/content/media/2018/02/3seq_manual.20180209.pdf)
for more detail.

This file is used by `py3seq` if you do not supply a file to the
`RecombinationAnalysis` constructor. Actually, that's not quite true yet,
but hopefully will be soon! Just run `3seq -c PVT.3SEQ.2017.700` to have
`3seq` record the name of this file as its default. See the
[top-level README](../../README.md).
